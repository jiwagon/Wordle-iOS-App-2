# Project 2 - Wordle Pt. 2

Submitted by: Ji Zhang

Wordle is an app that has a word puzzle game where players have several attempts to guess a word, with each correct letter placement revealed by color hints after each guess. Users can select the number of guesses from 3 to 8 and the number of letters for the goal word from 4 to 7. There are different word theme: Normal, Animals, and Countries. To make the game more challenging, users can select Alien Wordle mode, in which each guess has a new goal word, meaning users only have one guess to get the word right! 

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Notes

The exercises were challenging enough for me, but I did not get stuck at any part for a significant amount of time. The instructions, hints, and comments provided were sufficient for me to solve the errors independently.

However, I did modify the strings of the word arrays in the WordGenerator file. There were 8-letter words in the supposedly 7-letter words array and 7-letter words in the supposedly 6-letter words array, so I replaced those incorrectly placed words.
